You control a ship sailing the Lake of York and are tasked with completing different quests along the way.

# Takeover
On top of any requirements the original team did not complete, we are also implementing:
- Power ups (plunder system)
- Obstacles and bad weather
- Different levels of difficulty
- Combat with other ships
- Ability to save the state of a game and resume at a later time

We are using GitHub Actions for our Continuous Intergration.
