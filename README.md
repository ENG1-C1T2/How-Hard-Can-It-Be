You control a ship sailing the Lake of York and are tasked with fulfilling certain quests along the way.

You use WASD keys to control the direction of the ship. The cannon can be fired in the direction of the mouse with a left click, or in the direction of the ship with the spacebar.

# Takeover
On top of implementing any requirements the original team did not complete, we are also implementing:
- Power ups
- Different levels of difficulty
- Ability to save the state of a game and resume at a later time

Also, we are implementing a continuous intergration testing plan.
